	So put me on a boat headed out to sea.</h1>
<h2>Please send along my fishing pole
For I've been invited to fishin' hole
To fill your heart with every wish.</h2> 
<h3>Don't worry, or feel sad for me,
I'm fishin' with the Master of the sea.</h3> 
<h4>We will miss each other for awhile, 
But you will come and bring your smile.</h4>
<h5>That won't be long you will see,
Till we're together you and me.</h5>
To all of those that think of me,
<h6>Be happy as I go out to sea.</h6> 
<h7>If others wonder why I'm missin' 
Just tell 'em I've gone fishin'</h7></p>
