	<p> I've finished life's chores assigned to me,</p>
	<p>So put me on a boat headed out to sea. </p>
<p>Please send along my fishing pole</p>
<p>For I've been invited to fishin' hole</p>
<p>I'm fishin' with the Master of the sea. </p>
<p>We will miss each other for awhile,</p>
<p>But you will come and bring your smile.</p>
<p>That won't be long you will see,</p>
<p>Till we're together you and me.</p>
<p>To all of those that think of me,</p>
<p>Be happy as I go out to sea.</p> 
<p>If others wonder why I'm missin'</p> 
Just tell 'em I've gone fishin'</p>
