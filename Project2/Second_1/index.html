	<p><h2>I've finished life's chores assigned to me,</h2>
	<h1>So put me on a boat headed out to sea.</h1>
 Please send along my fishing pole
For I've been invited to fishin' hole
To fill your heart with every wish. 
<h2>Don't worry, or feel sad for me,
</h2>
<h1>I'm fishin' with the Master of the sea.</h1> 
We will miss each other for awhile, 
But you will come and bring your smile.
<h1>That won't be long you will see,</h1>
<h2>Till we're together you and me.
To all of those that think of me,</h2>
<h1> Be happy as I go out to sea.</h1>
If others wonder why I'm missin' 
Just tell 'em I've gone fishin'</p>
