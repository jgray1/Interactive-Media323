	So put me on a <h1>boat</h1> headed out to sea. 
Please send along my</h3> <br><li>fishing</li> </br> <h3><h1>pole</h1>
For I've been invited to</h3> <li>fishin'</li> <h3>hole
To fill your <h1>heart</h1> with every wish. Don't worry, or feel sad for me,
I'm </h3><li>fishin'</li> <h3>with the Master of the sea. 
We will miss each other for awhile, 
But you will come and bring your smile.
That won't be long you will see,
Till we're together you and me.
To all of those that think of me,
Be happy as I go out to sea. 
If others wonder why I'm missin' 
Just tell 'em I've gone</h3> <li>fishin'</li></p>
