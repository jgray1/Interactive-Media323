	<p>I've finished life's chores assigned to me,
	So put me on a boat headed out to sea.
  <br><br>
 Please send along my fishing pole
For I've been invited to fishin' hole
To fill your heart with every wish.
<br><br> Don't worry, or feel sad for me,
I'm fishin' with the Master of the sea. <br><br>
We will miss each other for awhile, 
But you will come and bring your smile.<br><br>
That won't be long you will see,
Till we're together you and me.</p>
<h2>To all of those that think of me,
Be happy as I go out to sea. 
If others wonder why I'm missin' 
Just tell 'em I've gone fishin'</h2>
