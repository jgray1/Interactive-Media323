	<p> I've finished life's chores assigned to me,
		So put me on a boat headed out to sea.</p> 
		<br>
		
              Please send along my fishing pole
              <br><br>
              <br><br>
        <p>For I've been invited to fishin' hole
              To fill your heart with every wish.</p>
              
              <br>
               Don't worry, or feel sad for me,
               <br><br>
              <br><br>
        <p>I'm fishin' with the Master of the sea. 
              We will miss each other for awhile,</p> 
              
              <br>
        But you will come and bring your smile.
        <br><br>
        <br><br>
              <p>That won't be long you will see,
        Till we're together you and me.</p>
        
        <br>
			  To all of those that think of me,
			  <br><br>
			  <br><br>
		<p>Be happy as I go out to sea. 
			  If others wonder why I'm missin'</p>
			  
			  <br> 
		Just tell 'em I've gone fishin
