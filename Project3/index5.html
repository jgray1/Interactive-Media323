  <p>I've come back as a sailor  <br>
Then I drowned while out at sea <br>
I've come back as a mother <br>
died in pregnancy<br>
Each time, there is a feeling <br>
That I've been in this place in time <br>
I can't explain the feeling <br>
I'm in a groove, not on a line <br>
I'm lost, but I don't know it <br>
I'm lost, but I can't tell <br>
I'm lost, but I don't know it <br>
I'm lost, in times deep well <br></p>
