  <p>You know, I didn't even know it<br>
That I was lost, until you came<br>
into my life and found me<br>
because you too had felt the same<br>

Until you came along and found me<br>
I didn't know I was lost...but you<br>
Came into my life and found me<br>
I guess that's what soul mates do.<br>

I'm lost, but I don't know it<br>
I'm lost, but I can't tell<br>
I'm lost, but I don't know it<br>
I'm lost, in times deep well<br>
