  <p>i've lived three hundred lifetimes<br>
i know three hundred ways to die<br>
I can't stop coming back here<br>
I know, because I've tried<br>

An endless cosmic circle<br>
Where my soul is on the move<br>
I've lived three hundred lifetimes<br>
I'm stuck in an empty, hollow, groove<br>

I'm lost, but I don't know it<br>
I'm lost, but I can't tell<br>
I'm lost, but I don't know it<br>
I'm lost, in times deep well</p>
