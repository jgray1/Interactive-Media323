  <p>i've lived three hundred lifetimes
i know three hundred ways to die
I can't stop coming back here
I know, because I've tried
 
An endless cosmic circle
Where my soul is on the move
I've lived three hundred lifetimes
I'm stuck in an empty, hollow, groove
 
I'm lost, but I don't know it
I'm lost, but I can't tell
I'm lost, but I don't know it
I'm lost, in times deep well
