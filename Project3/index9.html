  <p>I know that I have met you<br>
Once or twice our paths have crossed<br>
There's a feeling that surrounds you<br>
But, still I feel that I am lost<br>

After three hundred seven lifetimes<br>
Before I'm in the ground<br>
I've got a feeling that we're special<br>
I'm lost as lost, but, not quite found<br>

I'm lost, but I don't know it<br>
I'm lost, but I can't tell<br>
I'm lost, but I don't know it<br>
I'm lost, in times deep well<br>
